Project Description
[A website that helps remove negative emotions.]

The Problem statement
[In today's fast-paced world, people often experience fluctuations in their mood due to various personal, professional, or social factors. These mood swings can affect their mental health and overall well-being. However, tracking and managing mood patterns can be difficult, especially when individuals donâ€™t have a clear understanding of the emotional triggers they experience on a daily basis.

The lack of easy-to-use tools for mood tracking and the absence of real-time emotional support make it challenging for individuals to monitor and improve their emotional states. Additionally, many people feel isolated when trying to express their emotions, further affecting their mental health.]

The Solution
[The MoodTracker app provides users with an intuitive interface to track their mood and receive real-time, mood-appropriate responses from an AI-powered chatbot. By selecting their current mood from a range of options, users can engage in a supportive conversation that helps them understand and manage their feelings. This not only assists in emotional awareness but also encourages positive interaction and mental well-being.

This application aims to foster emotional intelligence, providing users with a platform to better understand their emotions and take proactive steps toward improving their mood.]
